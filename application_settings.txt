The chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical data, 
and Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous data, as appropriate. 
The quantile-quantile normality plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to assess whether a continuous variable was normally distributed.
